# Crypto Price Checker (Real Time)

The **Crypto Price Checker** is the first part of my crypto bot project that will automatically trade cryptocurrencies. In its current form, this program continually checks the price with live data from [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com) which is sent back to the program. So far, only **ETH** and **BTC** are tracked but I am planning to increase the number of coins quite soon! Stay tuned...

## Creator
- The Crypto Price Checker was created by [Alexander Tomsovic](github.com/alexandertomsovic)
- Envisioned by A.R.T.
